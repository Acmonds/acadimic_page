Welcome to my academic page! I'm Yangke Li, studying for a Research Master degree at the Hamlyn Centre, Imperial College London. My main areas of study are deep learning and computer vision.

I've been focusing on medical imaging applications since 2023, especially using imaging devices like endoscopes, Raman spectroscopy, and pCLE microscopes. You can check out my publications at here.<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GOOGLE_ACA_ID'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>

Beyond academic research, I also enjoy creating small software tools and contributing to the open-source community.

On this website, you'll find information about my research, papers, and projects. If you're interested in my work or want to talk about potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to get in touch using the contact details provided.

- The method merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Transformer to efficiently generate multi-scale depth maps from images, offering fast inference and comparable performance without increasing network size.
- A masking mechanism in used to reduces reflections in endoscopic images, improving depth estimation by focusing on non-reflective areas.
